What To Do:

Design and implement an online social list (SL) using ASP.NET and MySQL.
Create yourID.sql (where yourID is your loging ID on the CS network, i.e., your UA email ID) and write the DDL, DML statements to create your database, its table(s) and a few records (e.g. Yingcai Xiao, 330-972-5809, 123 ABC Rd, 1888/8/8, â€¦). Each record contains the following: name, phone, address, DOB, a thumbnail photo (optional), FaceBook link, twitter link, and any other info you want to list.
Create SL.aspx to allow users to operate the application.
Provide the following minimum operations: viewing current records, adding a new record, modifying an existing record, and deleting a record.
The thumbnail photo should be stored in MySQL as a BLOB. When the user clicks on it, a full size photo should appear. The full size photo should be stored on the application server under your directory. This is optional for 10 extra points! (Hints:  your program has to load the photos to the server first and you have to use the absolute path when loading and unloading files at the server side.)
Provide an online manual to instruct users how to use your SL.
